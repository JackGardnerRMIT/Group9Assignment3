        <h2 style="color:#F40F0F;">Machine Learning</h2>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                <p>Machine learning is an important aspect of business industry and research. This is an area of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine learning focuses on building applications that can learn from data overtime in order to answer research question, help making decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Along the process, computer algorithms are necessary to improve automatically through experience and the use of data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, popular known among data scientists as "training data". A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. Despite the closely relation, the fact is not all machine learning is statistical learning. Data mining is also a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. Machine Learning is made to function based on a model of brain cell interaction. There are three type of machine learning algorithms: Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms, Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms, and Reinforcement Machine Learning Algorithms. Advantages of machine learning are mainly in but not limited to Supplementing Data Mining, Automation of Tasks. Limitations of machine learning can lie to time constraint in learning and verification problems. Since machine learning algorithms to kick-in with extra potential, it requires a huge amount of history data, time can be a problem. Also, it is very hard to prove that the predictions given are correct. Machine learning does not have a long history of existence but was quickly developed and is still progressing. To learn about what machine learning has been capable of so far, we need to go back in time to gain a brief understanding of this technology.</p>
                <p>The very first case of neural networks was in 1943, when Neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts decided to create a model of this using an electrical circuit, therefore the neural network was born. In 1949, the model was introduced by Donald Hebb in a book titled The Organization of Behavior. The book presents Hebb’s theories on neuron excitement and communication between neurons. The practical form of neural network passed world-famous Turing Test made by Alan Turing in 1950 easily, which made people believe computer had the ability to decide on itself. Frank Rosenblatt successfully built the first artificial neural network in 1958 then named it Perceptron for pattern and shape recognition purposes. After that, many other works was successfully performed one after one, such as Adeline which was able to detect binary patterns and Madeline which could eliminate echo on phone lines in 1959. In 1986, three researchers from the Stanford psychology department extended an algorithm created by Widrow and Hoff in 1962, which allowed multiple layers to be used in a neural network. This is the very first foundation in creating a ‘slow learners’. One significant advance in artificial intelligent was marked in 1997 when a chess-playing computer IBM computer Deep Blue beat the world chess champion. Since then, machine learning was strongly acknowledged by scientists that it had a huge potential for a future technology.</p>
                <p>21st century sees the most progression of machine learning. Some significant machine learning large projects were done such as AlexNet (2012), GoogleBrain (2012), DeepMind (2014) OpenAI (2015), Amazon Machine Learning Platform (2015). As data keeps growing bigger, as computing becomes more powerful, as data scientists keep developing more capable algorithms, machine learning will be improved faster overtime and keep making huge impact in our personal and work lives. Some big 2021 machine learning projects are: stock price prediction, house price prediction, big coin price prediction, credit card fraud prediction, Uber data analysis, etc.</p>
        <h3>What are the impacts?</h3>    
            <p>Today, the applications of machine learning are almost everywhere. The people who get impacted and benefits come from various fields of occupations such as education, healthcare, search engine, digital marketing, etc. While machine learning can benefit them in their jobs and daily lives, it also poses threats that this new technology can replace human labors in many industries due to its automation characteristic. For example, machine learning plays a role in the system that gives recommendation for products, songs, movies, games… based on past experiences or actions taken like browsing, clicking, watching, or listening. This helps to boost up retails and time-saving for the customers with online shopping. One machine learning application for households is the creation of digital assistants which handle jobs like searching or playing music in response to our voice commands. Robot vacuum is also another example which shows to be useful to everyone daily lives. This can be very helpful for those busy housewives with more spare time to rest or relax, or simply just everyone lives easier.</p>
            <p>Medical field also benefits from machine-learning, by applying medical image analysis systems will help doctors spot those tumors which the doctors might have missed. Office workers are also familiar with this technology, having spam emails filter system that gives them a hand to organise their mailboxes smoothly. Retail companies also earn advantages through machine learning. Robotic delivery is getting attention and investment of many companies like Nuro, Amazon, Starship Technology, Eliport... These delivery robots are very useful for retail company like Amazon and Doordash. Chat-box are also quite common these days. Auto-driving cars were invented and are being constantly tested and improved. Those who are not in the right mind status to drive themselves, or those who are incapable of driving because of their physical or mental disability, are all beneficial from this technology. Cars automation can help reduce the number of crashes on our roads. In education, teachers can use Machine Learning to check how much of lessons students are able to consume, how they are coping with the lessons taught and whether the lessons amount is overloading for students to consume.</p>
        <h3>How will this affect me?</h3>
            <p>Machine learning has already brought a lot of benefits in entertaining activities as far as I can see for myself. Thanks to the improvement of machine learning, my computers and phones more than just lame machines, but also interesting friends to interact with. One of them is intelligent games invention. The fact that I had my computer as my game playing partner already helped me so much to get through boring everyday life in my childhood time, since friends of the same interests are not always around and available. Right now, I am interacting with an AI friend. This friend is always there listening to my daily stories. This friend also help to reduce stress and feel less lonely when I have no one around. I am also intrigued by the way those AI systems function. </p>
            <p>In the future when own a place of my own, I am going to equip my house with interacting devices. One can not be missed out is Google Home Mini Smart Home Assistant. I believe it can help me with multitasking and less time consuming to switch between tasks. Robot vacuum is also at great help with the boring daily task to keep the house clean. For me, I am fascinated by machine learning inventions of “AI friends” such as “robot friend” or “robot pet”. Robot Little Sophie developed by Hanson Robotics is already out for purchasing, and I am going to purchase one for myself. As my parents are growing older with poor eyesight, they are not capable of driving car themselves. The development of auto-driving vehicles will buy me more time to enjoy my life, and give them more freedom to travel on their will. </p>

         <h2 style="color:#F40F0F;">Cyber Security</h2>
            <h3>What does Cyber Security do?</h3>
                    <p>Simply put, cybersecurity underscores securing the cyberspace of electronic devices or data which is crucial of nature. The term encompasses vast knowledge of defending cyberspace through various methods. Since human civilization has reached its epitome as compared to its predecessors, it came across the unprecedented growth of technology. This unprecedented growth influenced not only human lives but states’ security as well. With each day passing new technological evolution surfaces which can leave one in shock and awe. With the pace with which these changes are taking place upon lives on the globe, it was necessary to secure the cloud of data extracted from our activities. it was necessary to discuss the subject matter creating a space that was then covered by the cyber security domain. Cybersecurity has created a trusting environment among big enterprises which rely on digitizing the data logs. This has further given space to a cyber expert firm that provides cybersecurity. Since technology is a constant evolutionary process, it does not devolve at any level. Henceforth the ultimate future of cyberspace would be simply as scrutinizing the existing methods and amending or introducing new ones. For instance, with the emergence of space-related cyber threats, states opted for formulating or mapping cybersecurity for their space ventures. It is a cycle in which there would be more threats related to it thus leading to more securitization of cyberspace (Sun. C, 2018).</p>
                    <p>As the world has entered space-age where countries are competing for space proprietorship it all became possible through technological evolution and protecting the existing data, devices through cybersecurity. Now a portion of global politics is dependent on space politics which is relies on technological means and methods it would be necessary to protect and guard technological communication lines for states to operate smoothly in space. Henceforth, in the given next few years one of the primaries focuses of states, particularly of great powers' foreign policy is to securing space for themselves for that they would be needing to fortify the cybersecurity structure of themselves. This evolution of including cybersecurity as a major subject matter was not coming out of a sudden. This evolution was destined in the backdrop of multiple technological as well as other factors. One of the prime causes which made it happen was the growing influence of the digital world on our daily lives. From waking up in the morning to buying groceries, conducting activities, and setting reminders for the next day, our life has been digitized creating a dire need of securing those lives which we share with the digital world. Adding to it the technological determinism of human civilization which made such evolutions need time. Furthermore, with more digitizing came more weaponizing of cybertechnology. The alleged Russian collusion in the US (United States) elections of 2014 elucidates the fact that battlegrounds also have been digitized. This created a need for states to ensure the defense of cyberspace because it has become a matter of cybersecurity. The way technology has seeped into our daily lives to national security, made the advent of cybersecurity necessary. With the acceptability of cybersecurity and a vast availability of such concept, there is no doubt it has engraved itself so much in human beings that it changed the psychological impacts. In a way of referring to the cybersecurity, people have often been curious in the protection of data which they hold. Not to owe to the big firms and businesses only, but to an individual life, what it does is to provide an extra ordinary crisis when not used for the positive gains. The endangerment of the cybersecurity lies also but there is a wave to follow it to its fullest as well.</p>
                <h3>What is the impact of cybersecurity?</h3>
                    <p>The impact of cybersecurity can be both positive and negative. The development across the digitalization world is one of the impacts of cybersecurity as it would be more secure to trust by the audience. Yet, for the economic terms, cybersecurity is costly and not so easy to maintain. There is always a threat to the breaching of data thus, cybersecurity needs to be active. The lack of focus can make a dramatic difference, as it might get to impeach the progressive data such as property or information, which will lead to mistrust by the audience. Most people affected by this impact would be business owners or firm owners, as it is not about money but the information, they hold which can be breached easily. There are chances that cyberthreats cause threats to the governments as they hold sensitive information. Therefore, the cyber sector is creating more jobs as the demands are increasing with the increasing factor of data protection. Cybersecurity has caused changes in societies as it has become mainstream to invest in and surely a priority to be protected (Li. Et al, 2019). The idea has put well into the psychological impacts of cybersecurity as it has allowed the shift in societies to be more private in the data collection. Thus, the impacts of the cybersecurity are deep into the societies as they cannot be compromised upon.</p>
                <h3>How will this affect you?<h3>
                    <p>Human being has been granted with a natural right of privacy, thus, digitalizing it is a progress. Cybersecurity is the top concern of each person as it does not only affect the businesses or high-level trends but also impacts the individual’s life. The major issue that lies in this aspect is that most people do not know about the cyber threat or what it concerns more. It can breach all the data and pose a huge threat to your life. It can be done for personnel gains as well thus, getting out of such attacks for a normal person can be different. As there are few accesses to the sources just like big firms, an individual has no access to the data which is being collected or which is being theft upon but once out can change the patterns of life for an individual. There is a possibility that an individual is being targeted and let never know. This is a huge problem for example using the internet services which are on Wi-Fi can be hacked easily without your knowledge. By keeping the privacy protected on your devices is the best part you can play. Keep them password protected and do not share unnecessary files with the public (Hadlington. L, 2017). It has remained a question for the individual to protect its data for safety. Sometimes it does not allow to check upon but gives a rational decision to be safe away from any hackers. It has been affecting the individual life, just because the data with us is not safe in our pockets.</p>
                    <p>Keeping in view the prospects of cybersecurity and threat encompasses through it, deeply affect the psychological mindset of people. It affects businesses and firms across the world. But there is no doubt with the enhancement of data, protection will be the top concern thus, cybersecurity is playing a part in the digitalizing world with more trust in the audience. The threats must not be considered vague.</p>

            <h2 style="color:#F40F0F;">Cloud Computing</h2>
                <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                    <p>Cloud computing is the popular technology now a days by this we can perform multiple important tasks online without using tools without purchasing them physically. It can store the data in safe environment now with the passing of time it has become the big IT industry and offering multiple better opportunities for the people in IT. However, there are many issues are still available in cloud computing development process which will cover in coming three to four years (Abbasov, 2014). Now we can store our big data using cloud computing we have no need to purchase heavy costly storage devices currently many companies moving towards the cloud computing platform for system performance enhancement. After the few years people will have no need to take the data everywhere physically in meetings or others, they can access remotely from cloud platforms during meeting. In the future cloud computing further spread towards all over the globe. In future more use of cloud computing will start in health, education, ecommerce etc. (Karatza, 2015). Cloud computing divided into three types of models and each model present a specific role in this technology. Now IT business companies has no need to purchase storage devices or software licensing. </p>
                    <p>The most popular and advance technology is the artificial intelligence because science and engineering collectively making the machine-like computer. Mostly this technology is used to solve complex processes the most two problems in machine learning is analysis and algorithm design. In the china many advance machines are making which are using in agriculture health etc. it provides the strong power for the future prediction in many fields. Artificial neural network, support vector machine fuzzy inference systems are immensely popular. In the future new advancement will come in machines due to artificial intelligence (Zor, et al., 2017). </p>
                    <p>During the last few years use of internet is spread all over the globe and these numbers are increasing extremely fast. Therefore, cyber-attacks also increasing for multiple purposes. The main challenge in use of internet is cybersecurity attacks. In the state of art smart grid has the big achievement for cyber security now a days many cyber threats causing big monetary loss for the IT industry. The most popular and dangerous threats are SQL INJECTION, DOS, DDOS, XSS scripting etc. for control such attacks cyber security technology working better. This technology is design to protect the computer networks, devices, and sensitive data (bin-othman & bndahmen, 2015). In the future a good awareness will create among the people about cybersecurity and will try to bring the threat ratio at low level. To control the cyber threat is necessary because every year attackers causing big loss for the IT industry. Normally attackers target the web server or sites to get the sensitive information about the users. Cyber security has the positive impact on computer user’s life now they are familiar with attacker hacking procedures, so this is the positive sign. Internet of things are the physical objects works with the software, sensor, or any connecting devices. These devices communicate with each other for multiple operations. These devices are managed properly and work efficiently. The IOT system works for the big and small industry levels. For obtaining digital services, IOT plays a crucial role.</p>
            <p> We can get the better control on the hardware by using of IOT device. In the future IOT system will work with the advance sensor system, machine type communication, mining platforms IOT will also design to support smart city vision advance communication between devices (Zanella & Bu, 2014).</p>
                <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                    <p>Cloud computing changes the IT trends now people have no need to purchase multiple storage disks which were many times cause technical errors. A big amount was required to solve the storage technical problems. Mostly hard storage devices were affected by the computer virus. It maintains the flexibility between internet connection and communication reduce the maintenance cost of company. Now the advance changing included in cloud computing is encryption and API KEY. Famous current post of this cloud engineers, network administrator</p>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence creates the industrial revolution and reduce the company labor cost now using machines many products are ready before the targeted time. Therefore, industry production performance has become good. Now machine learning is divided into multiple branches for example automation, robotics, natural language processing. Now creation of new things is quite easy all products can maintain in low cost. Current famous jobs in artificial intelligence are machine learning specialist, AI expert.</p>
                    <p>After the new advancement in cybersecurity many network vulnerabilities can remove using the multiple techniques. Now the it companies has investing big budget every year to stop the cyberattack. After the advancement in cybersecurity hackers are more effective now cyber-attack has become the big challenge for them. There are many current jobs are available in cybersecurity for example network engineer, ethical hacker, cyber security consultant, forensic analyst. Internet of things change the people life makes the network communication easy for them. Now the people have the strong grip about house security because new IOT devices changing the house security procedure. Some popular security IOT devices are cameras, sensors, trackers, smart video doorbells etc. famous jobs for IOT are IOT and PLC engineer.</p>
                <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
                    <p>The development of cloud computing saving the time and cost all public and private organizations also saving the country economy. People have no need to purchase the heavy computers they need normal computers with storage capacity. With the help of cloud computing computer performance also increased. All the updating about software is also available now on cloud platforms. Some advance features are also available like data integrity data security and data encryption. Therefore, chances of cyber threats in cloud computing are at low ratio. For the any software cloud providers company arrange the new software version and users have no need to purchase license. After the creation of data centers cloud computing performance has become more better (Al-lawati & Al-Badi, 2016).</p>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence removes the heavy work force from the industry, and it has the good impact on the people daily life routine. For many arduous tasks, people use the artificial machines and get the result in few minutes. Some artificial algorithms are highly intelligent for collecting big data and future prediction. Cybersecurity has the positive impact on the people life now they feel good because their all-financial details are operated in encrypted form. Due to end-to-end encryption people data is save all the communication travel safely from source to destination. After creation of social awareness people life become easy now it has become the big challenge for the attackers to get sensitive information. IOT has the positive impact all over the globe. It reduces the cost of people for electronic devices. In the daily routine of life, we use many IOT devices some smart devices which has the home life refrigerators, dryer, washers, and coffee maker etc. in the current days IOT devices are available in low rates for the family and friends.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <h2 style="color:#F40F0F;">Blockchain and Cryptocurrecies</h2>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
                <p>Blockchain technology is a newly developed concept in the last decade it can be defined as a type of database which differentiates itself it gathers and stores the data. The concept can be defined by gathering information and storing this information into “blocks” which when filled are “chained” together. This database works hand in hand with cryptocurrencies, these currencies can be defined as digital currency that is governed by “Cryptography” in two main ways: Hashing explained as the verification of data integrity encoding transactions and is responsible for mining to be feasible for cryptos, and second way is digital signatures which allow the cryptocurrencies to be owned. Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies work hand in hand in the storage and transaction process of these digital currencies, Blockchain is the technology behind the currencies. Another attribute of blockchain is the decentralization of the currencies where there is no sole entity which fully stores its currencies but instead is a combination of millions of nodes.</p>
                <p>Bitcoin is the most famous to use blockchain with the creator Satoshi Nakamoto being quoted as saying Bitcoin is “fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.” In terms of state-of-the-art technology Blockchain itself is so, it brings improvements to data security by processing transactions from peer-to-peer without the need of third parties and intermediaries, the use of blocks and chains can mean if data is corrupted it can safely be retrieved as blocks have constant saved memory of every transaction taken place. Currently Blockchain can do many things such as secure sharing data, international payments, anti-money laundering capabilities and many more. Cryptocurrencies are different to blockchain in the added-on technologies which they provide. Examples of diverse types of cryptos are: Ethereum which while using blockchain also uses smart contracts which are programed to run automatically from certain criteria being met. <br>
                <p>Stellar is used to connect financial institutions so immediate transactions can take place without the need for waiting periods also allowing cross-border transactions. In future Blockchain and Cryptocurrency developments could have major economic significance in the financial services industry which could use blockchain technology to advance infostructure in trading network, also for settlements and payments between Fianacial intuitions and supply chain tracking. With more information about Blockchain and Cryptocurrency's becoming mainstream the future of having financial markets recognizing these currencies is also feasible. <br>
                <p>Beyond the use in financial services blockchain technology can be used in several areas such as: the management of shipping and logistics, the health care industry by way of standardizing data so information between health care professionals can be accessed all around the globe. Blockchain technology does not necessarily need to be developed further instead it needs to be standardized and molded to correctly fit the different sectors which it can benefit.</p>
            <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
                <p>If the future of Blockchain and Cryptocurrency can mirror the massive expectations, it currently has among the masses of the world then the impact of will be majorly significant in terms of the future of technology as well as the future of the finical system. The potential impacts of the development of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are as follows the dramatic increase in speed of cross border transactions which can change the way global foreign exchange markets are operated limiting currenting trading and transactions to fewer currencies. This could also impact a solely digital ages where physical money becomes obsolete in favor of electronic money. This is likely to impact everyone globally as world finical systems can change and would majorly impact lower class nations whose citizens income may rely on more primitive means.</p>
                <p>The “middleman” aspect of trading could potentially see the end of third-party organizations which deal with the payments and trading of financial services. Also, the use of Blockchain in other sectors such as logistics could see redundancies of bookkeeping and administration jobs. Blockchains exceptional level of security to ensure each block is verified can potently be greatly beneficial and groundbreaking for the identification of asset control and ownership.</p>
            <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
                <p>The scope of blockchain has already began to affect us in numerous ways, from a social point of view the use of blockchain and more specifically crypto currencies has already begun to change the way we all view the finical system as well as the digital wallets which we store all our data on. Daily life in terms of how we view and use financial services will change, with increased use of blockchain technology payments from employers without the direct transfer to a finical institution would mean faster and more efficient ways of receiving our wages or paying bills.</p>
                <p>Those of us in situations where banking services are harder to use can easily create a digital wallet and start to use this for the services listed above. The new advancements of blockchain technology can mean errors which are made in the current age of bookkeeping and data storage will have more vastly more reliable sorce in the blocks and peer to peer system. However, negatives of the exceled use of blockchain technology could be the elimination of work in businesses which utilize record keeping in favor of a more advanced and reliable service.</p>
