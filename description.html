            <p>This is the Project Description page, it includes specific details about the project. These details include aims, plans and progress, roles, scope and limits, tools and technology, testing, timeframe, risks, and group progress and communication. A basic overview of the project can be found in the <a href="overview.html">Project Overview</a> page.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Aims</h3>
            <p>The main aim which our group intends on achieving is to, have an asset trading simulation which can be used as a support tool to compliment traditional learning methods for students and teachers. This aim is highly ambitious but is mainly in line with the overall basics of the idea. For students to have the knowledge and skills to trade and invest assets a program must be delivered which meets standards of the education system of Australia as well as being a reliable and proven recourse for students to learn. For our program to be adopted nationally would mean to was successful developed a simulation which teaches kids and young adults, how they can trade and uses these lessons in real asset markets to hopefully have some level of financial independence. The highly ambitious aim will be met mainly with smaller hurdles which will allow progress to the aim to be much more seamless, with a one step at a time analogy to have a lot of significance here.</p>
        <p>One goal which our project will have to face are “game goals” which is developing the game in a certain way that the end objective is satisfying to the player in this case a student, this is to create an appealing nature to the simulation and in turn will promote the expansion and utilisation of the learning goals (discussed below). This goal will be to make as much “money” as possible to have the highest score to win prizes at the end of the teaching period. The reason this goal is so important is because it is the reason the student will want to have a NEED to play satisfying their own sense of importance and stimulation. This will in turn keep the students playing the game, keeping them focused throughout the duration of the term and might even lead to a healthy level of completion amongst the students to achieve the best they can to win. Without a strong “game” goal the students might only see the program as another boring learning-based game with zero level of consideration to their engaging motivation to play. Overall, this goal is to have the students which participate in these games and activities to have fun and enjoy playing, and the only way to achieve this is by creating end goals and targets as well as to place trials in the beta of the program to get concise feedback as to which parts can be improved on or expanded upon as well was removed altogether. </p>
        <p>Another major goal for us to achieve are learning based which is to provide the knowledge of trading stocks and financial planning through the game play. These “learning goals” specifically are to creating a basic to moderate level of understanding of these real-life based concepts. To achieve this target should be placed in game and changed weekly which can only be achieved through gathering an understanding of the concepts of trading, examples would be “trade and achieve 10% returns on a given stock” this weekly challenge will require some level of research into company analytics as well as technical and fundamental analysis of company’s they wish to trade. Learning based goals are essential as it illustrates the result of how well the game has been at teaching students about finance. Without learning based goals and only game goals the simulation will not have any backing by education boards and thus will not be in line with the main aim of teaching students. </p>

        <p><b>About The Project</b></p>
        <p>This project involves developing a simulation-based game for children who are 12 years or older (generally high school age) with a simulated trading environment to introduce to them how the stock trading operates and a general overview of the financial system which they will evidently pushed into once they are adults. The main goal of this game is to ensure that its users are introduced to the trading environment, thus providing them with a view of how the trading environment operates and the importance of investing, money management, and trading. Furthermore, critical skills instilled to the users may from participating in the game include analytical skills, research skills, and record-keeping. The goal of the simulation-based program also involves it being s support tool for the traditional learning methods which are already in place. </p>
        <p>To complete the project, we are supposed to undertake various software development-related activities, including scripting animations, developing game interfaces, and establishing the relevant textures. However, we need to complete systems analysis and design of the game before beginning any implementation activities. Various stakeholders, including students and teachers, need to be continually engaged when developing application to ensure that the final product meet the vision and goals for establishing the game to the users. In the beta stages of the game once a skeleton of the simulation has been developed, we can hope to have a sample of one to two schools to be our first traders for the feedback and for the program to be finely tuned.</p>
