            <p>This is the Project Description page, it includes specific details about the project. These details include aims, plans and progress, roles, scope and limits, tools and technology, testing, timeframe, risks, and group progress and communication. A basic overview of the project and the prototype can be found in the <a href="overview.html">Project Overview</a> page.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Aims</h3>
            <p>The main aim which our group intends on achieving is to, have an asset trading simulation which can be used as a support tool to compliment traditional learning methods for students and teachers. This aim is highly ambitious but is mainly in line with the overall basics of the idea. For students to have the knowledge and skills to trade and invest assets a program must be delivered which meets standards of the education system of Australia as well as being a reliable and proven recourse for students to learn. For our program to be adopted nationally would mean to was successful developed a simulation which teaches kids and young adults, how they can trade and uses these lessons in real asset markets to hopefully have some level of financial independence. The highly ambitious aim will be met mainly with smaller hurdles which will allow progress to the aim to be much more seamless, with a one step at a time analogy to have a lot of significance here.</p>
        <p>One goal which our project will have to face are “game goals” which is developing the game in a certain way that the end objective is satisfying to the player in this case a student, this is to create an appealing nature to the simulation and in turn will promote the expansion and utilisation of the learning goals (discussed below). This goal will be to make as much “money” as possible to have the highest score to win prizes at the end of the teaching period. The reason this goal is so important is because it is the reason the student will want to have a NEED to play satisfying their own sense of importance and stimulation. This will in turn keep the students playing the game, keeping them focused throughout the duration of the term and might even lead to a healthy level of completion amongst the students to achieve the best they can to win. Without a strong “game” goal the students might only see the program as another boring learning-based game with zero level of consideration to their engaging motivation to play. Overall, this goal is to have the students which participate in these games and activities to have fun and enjoy playing, and the only way to achieve this is by creating end goals and targets as well as to place trials in the beta of the program to get concise feedback as to which parts can be improved on or expanded upon as well was removed altogether. </p>
        <p>Another major goal for us to achieve are learning based which is to provide the knowledge of trading stocks and financial planning through the game play. These “learning goals” specifically are to creating a basic to moderate level of understanding of these real-life based concepts. To achieve this target should be placed in game and changed weekly which can only be achieved through gathering an understanding of the concepts of trading, examples would be “trade and achieve 10% returns on a given stock” this weekly challenge will require some level of research into company analytics as well as technical and fundamental analysis of company’s they wish to trade. Learning based goals are essential as it illustrates the result of how well the game has been at teaching students about finance. Without learning based goals and only game goals the simulation will not have any backing by education boards and thus will not be in line with the main aim of teaching students. </p>

        <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Plan and Progress</h3>
             <h4 style="color:#F40F0F;">About the Project</h4> 
                <p>This project involves developing a simulation-based game for children who are 12 years or older (generally high school age) with a simulated trading environment to introduce to them how the stock trading operates and a general overview of the financial system which they will evidently pushed into once they are adults. The main goal of this game is to ensure that its users are introduced to the trading environment, thus providing them with a view of how the trading environment operates and the importance of investing, money management, and trading. Furthermore, critical skills instilled to the users may from participating in the game include analytical skills, research skills, and record-keeping. The goal of the simulation-based program also involves it being s support tool for the traditional learning methods which are already in place. </p>
                <p>To complete the project, we are supposed to undertake various software development-related activities, including scripting animations, developing game interfaces, and establishing the relevant textures. However, we need to complete systems analysis and design of the game before beginning any implementation activities. Various stakeholders, including students and teachers, need to be continually engaged when developing application to ensure that the final product meet the vision and goals for establishing the game to the users. In the beta stages of the game once a skeleton of the simulation has been developed, we can hope to have a sample of one to two schools to be our first traders for the feedback and for the program to be finely tuned.</p>   
            <h4 style="color:#F40F0F;">Aims and Objectives</h4> 
        
        
                <p>The main aim of establishing this game is to provide children from 12 years and above a simulated environment that will enable them to trade with virtual money, thus improving their trading, investment, and money management skills. Through the game, when such children become adults, they will have better stock trading and conscious decisions compared to the current and previous generations. There are three main objectives of undertaking this project.</p>
                    <li>To provide children with a simulated stock trading environment for the future real life uses which they will be applied. </li>
                    <li>To provide children with virtual currency that enables them to trade on the relevant stocks, while maintaining lower rates and limiting decimal places to keep following along as easy as possible for the younger students and ramping up difficulty as they get into the older year levels. </li>
                    <li>To track the progress of students in their trading journey, rewarding the students who have success in reading the simulated market which has been created for them, while simultaneously helping the students that struggle.   </li>

             <h4 style="color:#F40F0F;">How the Project Began</h4>     
                <p>The project began by identifying a trend where the last three decades have experienced booms and bursts within the stock market. Further, it was clear that advancements in technology have continued to enable more people to participate in activities related to stock trading. Thus, as more people continue to participate in stock trading, it is necessary to ensure that they can have the relevant skills to successfully execute stock trading-related activities. Thus, we proceeded to undertake more research on how we may help people acquire the relevant skills and experiences related to being successful stock traders. We identified that people need to be introduced to stock trading at a young age to grow while being exposed to trading environment. Thus, we determined that developing a game that simulates a real stock trading environment for children from 12 years is the best solution for stock traders.  </p>
                <p>Furthermore, the beginnings of this project while enforced by factual evidenced gained by research, there has also been much of an influence by the project director Eren and his firsthand experience with this issue. Once out of high school and working full time he had little to no experience working with larger sums of money which he was making, whether to invest, save, spend or manage the money these where all questions which he had stressed about late in the hours of night. Asking friends and family they all had the suggestion of investing; in the beginning of this new financial venture, he had found is very hard and struggled to run a profit if ever he made one. Stressed about the predicament which he was in he wondered what could have been if all the skills which he needed in the future could have been taught to him when he was still in high school, with a developing brain like a sponge. In this moment he believed he should pursue this obligation as the future youth of Australia should all have met a basic level of understanding when it comes to the financial system of stocks and money management. </p>
             <p><b>Major activities to be undertaken on the project</b></p>
                <p>Various activities need to be undertaken in this project. The main aim is to establish a working prototype by the end of the semester. Thus, there are various software development activities that will be undertaken. They include systems analysis and design, implementation, and deployment. System analysis involves collecting data about the application requirements, developing both functional and non-functional requirements, and then designing various UML diagrams on the mobile application. Implementation shall involve developing interfaces for the game, implementing the applications and process components of the game, and ensuring that the application's functionality is working adequately. This will lead to the establishment of a working prototype. While a working prototype is probably the largest of the activates and the most demanding, working with schools and gathering feedback from teachers and students is also majorly important as it can determine the future directions we will be embarking on. This will require weekly feedback reports by schools and teachers, as well as students writing summaries of the work, they had done for thew week flagging any bug which might have happened as well as aiding the finetuning process. </p>
             <p><b>Progress on the project</b></p>   
                <p>Currently, we have made remarkable progress based on undertaking various activities in the project. Considering that the stock market environment continues to experience rapid changes due to changing technologies, we opted to apply an agile approach towards how we develop the application. Thus, we are completing the first iteration towards establishing the prototype for the mobile application. We have already collected the functional and non-functional requirements for the application, which involved consulting various students, teachers, and financial experts towards understanding what would be needed in the application. We also utilized secondary sources such as the internet and journals to understand how modern stock simulation environments work. We have also undertaken designs for our prototype, including designing various UML diagrams that depict our game. Currently, we are undertaking the actual implementation of our prototype that will then be used as an anchor point towards describing what we aim to achieve with this project.</p>
             <p><b>Stage in the project </b></p>
                <p>Currently, we are in the implementation stage of implementing the project. Even though we are in the implementation stage of our project, this is only the first iteration of our prototype. This means that we will continue undertaking more iterations to improve the prototype based on user feedback (feedback from teachers and students). Thus, depending on the feedback we get, we will undertake further implementation in the future. Thus, the main activities were currently undertaking to include implementing the interfaces, implementing the server-side components, and debugging the code to ensure it is working.</p>
             <p><b>Challenges, dead ends, and decisions made.</b></p>
                <p> We have faced few challenges when undertaking this project. The first major challenge that affected us is the current covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has made it difficult for the team members to meet as physically and frequently as possible. Thus, we decided to utilize remote collaboration tools in undertaking this project. We thus opted to use zoom for having meetings in scenarios where we could not meet physically. We also utilized internet-based services such as emails in sharing documents when undertaking the project. We are also considering the use of GitHub as a version control system for our project. The second major challenge we have faced is a lack of enough experience in developing sophisticated professional applications. Thus, we continue to do more research and consult other developers to understand what needs to be done in completing the project.</p>
             <p><b>Changes made</b></p>
                <p>Initially, we had planned to utilize a waterfall methodology to undertake the project. Thus, we were considering undertaking the whole project from the beginning to the end. However, we realized that developing a sophisticated simulating app may take several iterations. Thus, we opted to use an agile methodology in undertaking the project. We intend to continue improving the application based on the feedback we get from users of the application.  </p>
                <p><b>Future activities and direction </b></p>
                <p>We intend to continue implementing various features on our prototype to ensure we establish a minimal viable product in the form of a prototype by the end of the semester. Once we complete our prototype, we will release it to a limited number of users (both students and teachers) to monitor their behavior and how they use the application. Furthermore, we will collect feedback from them to determine ways that we may improve the application to provide users with better experiences when using the application. Eventually, we aim to have a fully functional application that provides students and children with the opportunity to invest in the stock market information of a game. </p>

    <div class="box">
        <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Scope and Limits</h3>
            <p>The ASX Simulator application will be expected to have several features to try and simulate the stock market as accurately as possible, while also making it an educational game. The scope of the project first includes a registration and login system for accounts and profiles. People will have their own name and pictures and a profile with personal information, data, and stats to track their progress. It will also include a tutorial which will give a general education on stocks. It will also have a market index to show the current market to update users on the current trends to help them understand. It will also have industries and stockers per an industry; however, this could be unlimited so there will only be for mining, technology, and healthcare to keep things simple, each of those 3 industries will have 5 stocks. This keep things simple as this is targeted towards children to help them learn. There will also be a leaderboard with the top 100 users to keep things competitive and engaging. There will be a records page with the stats and tracking history of the user. The main part of the game will be where you can buy and sell certain stocks. Other features are outside of the scope of the project.</p>
            <p>In terms of limitations there are several major limitations that prevent the project form progressing. The first is the limitation on research, this project has a limited amount of time to be produced. Extensive research for the look, features and functionality of the app is limited which only allows for basic levels of development on the application. A lack of time has also led to less testing, where only basic testing of the application has happened. The application is limited to a basic level and does not have numerous features or fancy aesthetics due to lack of time and resources; this mostly comes in the form of labor.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Tools and Technology</h3>
            <p>The tools and technology for this project will be completely digital. All development will be on computers and using various application for various parts of the project. The hardware required to support the game will not be demanding as the game is not graphics intensive, basic schools' laptops will meet it needs of a minimum of i3 processors and 2, but preferably 4 or more GB of RAM. Every member of the project is required to have a computer to use these apps. One of the apps used is Teams. Teams is a key method of communication used to plan the development of the project and to communicate roles, deadlines, and anything worth noting. Another app used for communication is Facebook, which was used for reminders, pools and general messages and queries. The app used to create the design for the prototype was Figma, a website that allows for the design and development of apps and prototypes. While Figma could be used to develop the prototypes the Unity Game Engine could be used for the development of an actual application. The Unity version 2019.2.13f1 would be the most suitable version as it is a stable version with few bugs and errors while also having a plentiful variety of features to use for the prototype.</p>

            <p>One of the most important things we have to do to get a perfect work in our assignment is a group communication. we contact each other in Microsoft Teams and we do a voice call at least 2 times every week. We want everyone to attend the group meeting, so we decide when the group meeting will be every week. Sometimes one of the group members cannot attend at that time, so he can tell us before the meeting. We check with everyone in the group what another time they are fine with it, so we grantee we can all attend the meeting and if someone does not attend for emergency issue. He can see the record, and every meeting we write the important things in the chat. </p>
