            <h3>What kind of work is done by data scientists and who they mostly interact with?</h3>
                <p> In general, data scientists extract meaning from data, uncover insights and identify opportunities to inform business decision making as well as to gain more insights. </p>
                <p> Data scientists spend nearly 80% of their time cleaning and preparing data to improve its quality – i.e., make it accurate and consistent, before utilizing it for analysis. A data scientist can choose to have at least one among these 3 orientations: research-focused, business-focused, development-focused.</p
                <p> Research-focused data scientists usually work in long term projects and usually work with complex algorithms. Their jobs are transformation through development or implementation of new methodologies. They are required to have deep understanding of machine learning and statistics theories. They also need to get through research papers and really have good understanding of what is really going on. Usually for this position, a graduate degree in computer science is required. Research-focused data scientists will work will other scientists in different fields.</p>
                <p> Business-focused data scientists usually work in short term projects involves predictive modelling, outcome measurement and insights. Their tasks aim for optimizing business outcomes through data-based discoveries. Different from the research-focused data scientists, business-focused data scientists need to have a good effective communication skill alongside with excel and power points. Business-focused data scientists will have to present their work to clients or big to medium corporates. They could also work along-side with marketing specialists and business developers.</p>
                <p> Development-focused data scientists’ work is either developing machine learning, data pipelines, big data or the combination of all. To be able to successfully do their jobs, they are required to have a significant computer science knowledge, and very strong debugging skill. Development-focused data scientists work along with other data scientists to build good models. They usually work for data tech companies, especially those with centric products or data science focused line.</p>
            <h3> What aspects of their position are most challenging?</h3>
                <p>Common difficulties a data scientist may encounter:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li> Data preparation 
                          <p> Data scientists spend most of their time on cleaning and preparing data since these are the very first steps to begin with before analysis. However, a majority of scientists consider these jobs as the most boring, mundane part of their jobs. They are required to go through terabytes of data, across multiple formats, sources, functions, and platforms, on a day-to-day basis, at the same time keeping a log of their activities to prevent duplication. In order words, data scientists will have to find a way to overcome this repetition.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li> Multiple data sources
                          <p> To produce meaningful decisions, data scientists need to acquire data from different kinds of sources such as different types of apps and tools and generate different formats of data. Not to mention about the preciseness of each source, this process requires manual entry of data and time-consuming data searching, which leads to errors and repetitions, and eventually, poor decisions.</p>
                      </li>    
                      <li> Data security
                          <p> As organizations transition into cloud data management, problems arise. First, confidential data has become more vulnerable. Second, as a response to repeated cyberattacks, regulatory standards have evolved which have extended the data consent and utilization processes adding to the frustration of the data scientists.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li> Understanding the business problem
                          <p> To build best solutions for the problems, data scientists must make sure they thoroughly understand the business problem. Failing this step, no matter how good the solutions sound like, they end up making no sense. However, most data scientists follow a mechanical approach to do this without clearly defining the business problem and objective.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li> Effective communication with non-technical stakeholders 
                          <p> The lack of understanding of data science among management teams and stakeholders leads to unrealistic expectations on the data scientist, which affects their performance.   </p>
                      </li>
                  </ul>

        <h2 style="color:#F40F0F;">Cyber Security Expert - Jack</h2>
            <h3>What kind of work is done by Cyber Security Experts?</h3>
                <p>The main part of a Cyber Security experts' job is trying to stay one step ahead of cyber criminals. This involved tracking recent trends and methods used by cyber criminals and finding the best ways to defend from these attacks. There is also a lot of penetration testing where they will try to break into their own system to try to identify exploits and issues with their system and its defenses.</p>
            <h3>What kinds of people does the Cyber Security Expert interact with?</h3>
                <p>Cyber Security experts almost always interact with other IT professionals. They will early interact with investors and the general public. They may speak with clients if there has been a security breach and they intend to warn them or discuss helping them with cyber security. Usually, they interact with other IT professions who delegate plans on cyber security, which they work on with other professionals, such as organising a penetration test, fixing exploits and report writing on their status to superiors.</p>
            <h3>Where does the Cyber Security Expert spend most of their time?</h3>
                <p>Cyber Security Experts spend most of their time doing penetration attacks on their own systems, they simulate real cyber security attacks to test the systems defensive capabilities. They try to attack and access valuable information that a hack would be looking for. They often have a starting point of no privileges or the same as a regular employee to test different security levels. Other people such as employees may also pose a risk, whether they know it or not, they may be the victim of a phishing attack and need to be educated by the Cyber Security Experts about it to avoid it.</p>
            <h3>What aspect of the Cyber Security Experts position is most challenging?</h3>
                <p>The most challenging part of being a Cyber Security Expert is being ahead of Cyber Criminals and taking measures to prevent cyber criminals from exploiting their security systems. They must be aware of all the new methods and exploits used and how to best defend against them. This can be time consuming and difficult to keep up with given the considerable number of cyber criminals and the variety of methods that they use. </p>

        <h2 style="color:#F40F0F;">Network Engineer - Eren</h2>
            <h3>What kind of work is done by network engineers and who they mostly interact with?</h3>
                <p>An Information technologies network engineer are technicians which specifically are responsible for the setting and overseeing of networks which is defined as connection between two or more systems with use of hardware such as switches, routers, servers, and hubs. Once the network is set up and in use the network engineer will maintain the solidarity of the network. The work of a network engineer is both hands on and communication based with key personality skills required being communication between clients, analytical thinking to manage complex problems and curiosity to understand the scope of the issues which they might face any given day. Time is also spent learning and understanding the latest in technology which can further help and diversify the knowledge they have as well as keeping a competitive edge in the expending field which is IT.</p>
                <p>For network engineers the interactions are generally between the clients which they are representing and building networks for. They must have excellent communication skills to cover a wide array of tasks and needs that each client may want and need for their specific network. They also spend time communicating with hardware suppliers as it is essential to have somewhat of a business relationship with certain brands that offer network hardware, to ensure that bulk orders are meet and delivered on time for the creation of the networks.</p>
                <p>Typically for network engineers most of their time is spent on building the actual networks and manually creating connections between IT hardware for clients. The day is then spent overseeing the network(s) and making sure all areas are functioning properly and troubleshooting any issues which may arise.</p>  
            <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
                <p>The most challenging position which network engineers face is maintenance on downed servers this is because when working on servers they generally should not be accessed untill all issues are dealt with this can cause issues if the network being worked on is essential for a client's business to run and can cause extremely stressful situations to work as fast as possible for the client.</p>

        <h2 style="color:#F40F0F;">Information Systems Technician - Minfeng</h2>
            <h3>What kind of work is done in the IT profession?</h3>
                <p>The work done by an Information Systems Technician typically varies every day. Technicians use a ticketing system to ensure that they are on task, efficient and effective in their services. Technicians should never go to work expecting anything to happen as many tasks may spring out from nowhere, and all is managed on the ticketing system, where the technician works back and forth, trying to get things done.</p>
                <p>Technicians are constantly answering the phone and providing immediate solutions to problems and technical support when possible. They work with all sorts of problems that may come up, mostly “putting out fires”, which can be interpreted as solving trivial issues. They also work with account creations, use Active Directory to manage users, assist with networking issues, and work with computer imaging.</p>
            <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h3>
                <p>An Information Systems Technician interacts with clients, typically people with IT specific questions and issues. Customer service and technical support is a core aspect of this job. Clients contact the technicians through incoming calls and emails.</p>
            <h3>Where does the IT professional spend most their time?</h3>
                <p>The Information Systems Technician spends most of their time in the office receiving phone calls and manages emails, providing solutions to a myriad of problems. Although Information Systems Technicians spend much of their time in their offices, they go out into their respective clinics and their general facilities potentially for meetings and other activities.</p>
            <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
                <p>Some challenges the Information Systems Technician may face includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                          <li>Disconnection  
                              <p>An Information Systems Technician typically works independently and spends most of their time on their technological devices and phones. Aside from periodic meetings from time to time, little to no direct contact is necessary between the technician and other people, thus creating this isolating case.</p>
                          </li>
                          <li>Pressure
                              <p>Occasionally, the technician can face major technological issues and can take a long time, as well as a great amount of effort to resolve. The issue may even cause the technician to work overtime.</p>
                          </li>    
                          <li>Ambiguity
                              <p>What is expected of an Information Systems Technician is different every day, depending on the emergence of issues and shifting prioritisation. Their tasks can involve any unexpected issue, thus requiring a great amount of knowledge around IT. Shifting between different tasks can also be tiresome for them.</p>
                          </li>
                      </ul>
