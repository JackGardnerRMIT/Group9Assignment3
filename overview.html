        <h2 style="color:#F40F0F;">Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This is the Project Overview page, this provides a basic overview of the project and the prototype. Finer details can be found on the <a href="description.html">Project Description</a> page.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Topic</h3>
            <p>According to a study published in the American Economic Journal, which looked at booms and busts in the U.S. stock market between 1998 and 2011, and it keeps going on till today. As we are living in a stock-trading century, stock trading has eventually become one “hot” skill to obtain. Many people fail to equip this skill and knowledge, yet already jump right through to stock market instead can put their financial stability and mental health at risk. An article “Death by Investing: How a 10 Percent Loss Raises Mortality Levels” posted on webpage entrepreneur.com on May 28th, 2019, stated: “Among every 100 retirees with money in the market who suffered a 10 percent wealth shock, one additional person will die within the next two years, and 2.5 more will develop health problems, the study found.” Trading stock requires more than a talent, but a skill that can be trained overtime.</p>
            <p>Acknowledging the affects and needs for stock trading, the project idea we have is to build a simulation-based game which young children from ages 12 can play. This will simulate trading and giving a raw and initial understanding of trading, as well as buying and selling stocks. The project will be a game which trades on a small scale up to 10 dollars in total.   </p>
            <p>Thus, once successfully built, will introduce kids, high schoolers to understand the importance of money management, investing and trading. This system creates an environment where students who win and can compete with classmates and other schools can win awards.  </p>

    <div class="box">
        <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Motivation</h3>
            <p>Once out of school, young adults’ financial habits and investment are all new expressions with little experience in this filed. While we are told to finish school and get a job, saving the longevity and growth of our wealth is not expressed. With this game/program students can have some ideas of how the financial and trading system works and will have established ways of controlling and planning out their finances which is an integral part of growing up.</p>
            <p>Our application also helps young people explore their hobby in trading, encourages young talents to be discovered and motivates them to cultivate their talents at early years.   </p>
            <p>Alongside with helping the new generation to catch up with current trend to survive and grow, we also aim for improving mental health of the general population.   </p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Landscape  </h3>
            <p>Currently, there are some applications serve as stock trading stimulation applications. </p>
            <ul>For example:
                  <li>Investopedia Stock Simulator</li>
                  <li>Wall Street Survivor</li>
                  <li>MarketWatch Virtual Stock Exchange</li>
                  <li>HowTheMarketWorks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first tree applications mainly aim for adults or those who already have been out to work and have a wish to learn about stock trading to expend their earning sources.</p>
            <p>The fourth one, “HowTheMarketWorks”, however, target customers who are students of all age from middle school.</p>
            <p>The differences our application has is that we only aim for young students, which is limited to high school students who from grade 7 to grade 12. Besides educational purposes, we will develop our application easier to use, less complicated and the graphic design will be more friendly to those at an early age.  </p>
