        <h2 style="color:#F40F0F;">Project Idea</h2>
        <p>This page is about the project idea for our group.</p>
    </div> 
    
  <div class="box">
    <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Overview</h3>
        <p>According to a study published in the American Economic Journal, which looked at booms and busts in the U.S. stock market between 1998 and 2011, and it keeps going on till today. As we are living in a stock-trading century, stock trading has eventually become one “hot” skill to obtain. Many people fail to equip this skill and knowledge, yet already jump right through to stock market instead can put their financial stability and mental health at risk. An article “Death by Investing: How a 10 Percent Loss Raises Mortality Levels” posted on webpage entrepreneur.com on May 28th, 2019 stated: “Among every 100 retirees with money in the market who suffered a 10 percent wealth shock, one additional person will die within the next two years, and 2.5 more will develop health problems, the study found.” Trading stock requires more than a talent, but a skill that can be trained overtime.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging the affects and needs for stock trading, the project idea we have is to build a simulation-based game which young children from ages 12 can play. This will simulate trading and giving a raw and initial understanding of trading, as well as buying and selling stocks. The project will be a game which trades on a small scale up to 10 dollars in total.</p>
        <p>Thus, once successfully built, will introduce kids, high schoolers to understand the importance of money management, investing and trading. This system creates an environment where students who win and can compete with classmates and other schools can win awards.</p>
  </div>
    
  <div class="box">  
    <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Motivation</h3>
        <p>We believe this project is incredibly interesting because students growing up through high school are not shown trading and economic work. Also, alongside with helping the new generation to catch up with current trend to survive and grow, we also aim for improving mental health of the general population.</p>
        <p>Once out of school, young adults’ financial habits and investment are all new expressions with little experience in this filed. While we are told to finish school and get a job, saving the longevity and growth of our wealth is not expressed. With this game/program students can have some ideas of how the financial and trading system works and will have established ways of controlling and planning out their finances which is an integral part of growing up.</p>
        <p>Besides, our application helps young people explore their hobby in trading, encourages young talents to be discovered and motivates them to cultivate their talents at early years.</p>
 </div>
  <div class="box">
    <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Description</h3>
         <p>The game is to represent a microcosm of the financial system for high schools to join. The schools which openly participate in the game will download the game program given to them by the developers.</p>
         <p>A student will create a profile using their unique student number or by their unique identity. This is to ensure every student only has one account. They can join the game with this join code and begin buying and selling stocks.  Each student will be given a unique game code that can be used to re-join the game multiple times or on another device.</p>
         <p>Teachers also create account and register with their unique identity, managed by the school representator. Using that account, they can view each student's portfolio and progress. Teachers are the ones who play representative roles for their students and contact the game management group should anything go wrong.</p>
         <p>Students will be given a set amount of fictional money, let say AU$100, to begin their journey where simulated markets and businesses will be then traded where students can learn how their decisions make an impact on their overall financial status.  </p>
         <p>From the trading, students will have to establish some financial planning to maximize their wealth. The effort of students will be encouraged by the incorporation of a ranking system with classmates and other schools, with awards and certificates given out to the schools and students who perform the best.</p>
         <p>According to investopedia.com, some skills that are essential for traders. Those can include Analytical skill, Research skill, and Record keeping skill. These are also the goal that we aim for to train our players.</p>
         <p>Apart from trading function, the application will have education sessions to assist students go through step by step to build up their trading knowledge. This is a library with collective. They are especially useful for beginners. Rewards will be given to those who finish lessons and past tests for that session.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li> Analytical skill  
                      <p>Analytical skill starts with charts and indicators. It is represented through charts with indicators and patterns from technical analysis. Consequently, traders need to develop their analytical skills so they can recognize trends and trends in the charts.</p>
                      <p>Our library will show students skills on how to read charts and indicators. The library will contain both instruction videos and text based. I will also include examples with clear explanation. After each lesson there will be small tests. After each time students past a test, they will be given some money as a reward.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li> Research skill 
                      <p>Research skill is a separate skill which can stand alone by itself, though it plays one main role in trading skill. Traders need to have a healthy thirst for information and a desire to find all the relevant data that can impact their trades.</p>
                      <p>Basic knowledge to train their research skill will be presented to details in our library.</p>
                  </li>    
                  <li> Record keeping  
                      <p>If a trader records the results of his or her trades diligently, then improving is simply a matter of testing and tweaking strategies to find a successful one.</p>
                      <p>Our program has a record section for every player. Our system will record date, time, stocks, and its information that were traded. Here, our library will teach students more about how necessary it is to take this step seriously.</p>
                      <p>Overall, the game is to encourage financial planning and management, as well as a near identical trading simulation to understand how to make sales of stocks from companies and reading company analytics.</p>
                  </li>
              </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="box">
         <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Tools and Technologies</h3> 
          <p>To develop this game/program the software needed does not have to be incredibly demanding but should be built with an established and renowned game engine, for this reason the 2D gaming experience would be created using ‘Unity’.</p>
          <p>The hardware needed to support this game will not be very demanding and most school supplied laptops and desktops with i3 processors and above, 4gb of ram and more, and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) will run this program.</p>
   </div>    
  
   <div class="box">   
          <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Skills Required</h3> 
              <p>To create this game the skills that will be required are stem from the software side of the program and not so much the hardware as this will be easy to upload to any device as it will require a download and administration rights to install.</p>
              <p>The software skills required will be experience with scripting animations, textures, and interfaces and will also require a strong knowledge of c programming (programming language). The work requirements for this program being an intermediate level should be easy to find with the right advertisement.</p>
   </div>      
    
   <div class="box">   
          <h3 style="color:#F40F0F;">Outcome</h3> 
            <p>If the project were deemed a success from the schools, students and teachers who have participated in it then this would see a national roll out for the program to schools with state to country wide competitions held. More importantly, success would mean the sense of clarity high school students and young adults have when dealing with their finances becomes much easier. Not only that, but they would also understand the process and importance of investing their own capital as much as spending is fun.</p>
            <p>In short, this application can help students to build some main skills in trading stocks, building a portfolio, and learning about the stock market.</p>
            <p>We believe those skills will put the foundation to support an overall increased wealth, more stable mental health for newer generations, then may lead to the reduction of financial hardships are few and far between.</p>
