            <p>The similarities between group members prospective careers:</p>
            <p>The four members include Phuong, Jack, Jeff, Majeed aim to get a job in IT field.  These four members also come from IT background. </p>
            <ul> The difference between group members prospective careers:   
                <li>Majeed: 
                    Based on his ideal job description: IOS developer, he is probably the person who chooses take the path which requires most strong knowledge and skill in programming. The other members, however, aim to expose themselves to those fields that require a mixture of skills other than programming.  </li>
                <li>Jack:  
                    As he aims to be a penetration tester, he may be the next person after Majeed that will take on the jobs merely strong with programming and technical knowledge. Though being a tester will not require coding very often, he will need an adequate coding skill in order to help him tackle his jobs easier. </li>
                <li>Jeff:  
                    His ideal job is IT consultant, which will also require very general knowledge in technical devices and computers in general, not just coding. Communication is, however, particularly important to communicate with clients. Effective communication skill will help him to express his ideas better and get the job done smoothly. </li>
                <li>Phuong: 
                    Like Jeff’s, Phuong’s wishful field will require a mixture bunch of knowledge. Her career path will not follow much technical field, but rather working with data manipulation. Although this job does not require strong coding skill, she will need research skill, communication, and presentation skills.  </li>
                <li>Eren: 
                    Among the five members, his path is probably the most distinctive. He comes from business background, that is why he is aiming to take job as a stockbroker. His job may not require much coding skills or deep knowledge in computers, he does need deep knowledge in stocks and business in general. Communication skill is also essential.  </li>
